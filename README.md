A repository for the code and data associated to "A quantitative assessment of carnassialization in different clades of carnivorous mammals (Dasyuromorphia, Carnivora, Hyaenodonta) based on the curvature (DNE) of tooth crown surfaces" submitted to Journal of Morphology Oct 2020.

The placental order Carnivora represents not only the dominant group of extant carnivorous mammals, but also an ecomorphologically highly diverse and thus evolutionary successful group. Molar functional morphology has been postulated to play a key role in the evolutionary diversification of the Carnivora and may also explain why other groups of carnivorous mammals (Dasyuromorphia, Hyaenodonta) were evolutionarily less successful. Here we show that 3D-quantification of crown curvature of lower carnassial teeth, measured as the total Dirichlet Normal Energy (DNE) of the enamel cap, provides a morphometric tool for measuring the reduction of functional morphological features of the crown relief of carnassial teeth. Among dasyuromorphs, carnivorans and hyaenodonts, a diminution of DNE quantifies the convergent reduction of talonid (hypoconid, hypoconulid, entoconid) and metaconid cusps from lesser (basal) to higher (derived) carnassialized molars within each phyletic group. Among extant carnivorans species with a basal carnassialized functional morphology can be found in different clades (Vulpini, Viverridae, Herpestidae), indicating that this basal condition has been preserved throughout the evolutionary history of this group. In Hyaenodonta with derived carnassialized molars, surface quantification of all lower molars points to a simplification of functional morphology, which may have affected their ability to compete with more versatile groups like the Carnivora and therefore ultimately posed a disadvantage for adaptivity.
